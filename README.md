A project for the purpose of advancing my own knowledge through challenge.

Features being worked on:

- UI

Planned features:

- Recurring daily dues
- Cryptocurrency and financial monitoring
- Spotify manipulation through web API calls

---

I believe I've developed somewhat of a back-end in main for the dues.
In the future I may opt to shift this infrastructure to its own file.
For now I intend to move all tkinter implementation to its own file, and begin a new file implementing qt.
#####I started last night but my misconfiguration of git led to Atom eluding all my Ctrl-S presses it seems.

I've learned about tkinter and now I hope to learn more about qt and choose one as a primary moving forward.
This addition to the readme helped me learn that my git implementation of my local repo is correct.
It is the github package in my IDE failing to utilize it.

I believe I may have fixed it, and this commit would prove it.
