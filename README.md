Dev log:

I believe I've developed somewhat of a back-end in main for the dues. I've moved all tkinter implementation to its own file, and begun a new file for introducing equal implementations in qt. The book I'm using as study reference primarily uses PyQt5, but mentions the similarities to qt's official PySide in that they both serve to translate the qt framework from C++.

One thing that gains my interest in qt is supposed sql support. I haven't looked into this, but I'm curious about sql and databases. I may even eventually look into mongodb or other database software.

I fixed up the Tk UI and began implementing logging functionality. I still havent 100% figured out how I'm going to implement it but I hope for it to help later in life. As well as replace my current style of print-debugging.
